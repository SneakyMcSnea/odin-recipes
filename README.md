Create a basic Website structure with html and its most important elements

Reflection: The objective was to build a website (topic: food recipes) with an index.html Homepage
and 3 webpages, each containig an image, a description, a unordered list of ingredients and an
ordered list of steps to prepare the dish of the corresponding meal.
Besides the opportunity to deepen ones knowledge about basic website/page creation with html,
the assignment was especially valuable for practicing the workflows of VSC, Git and Github.
No major problems encountered. Not sure about the amount of commits and the value of the
commit messages. Had to peek into the Git/commit lessons more than once. All in all a very cool
assignment which is really helpful to practice the theory learned in the lessons so far.
